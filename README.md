# Working-Sudoku

This is a WPF game that will hopefully be converted into an App. 

Previous attempt had the WPF lay out, but never solved the Sudoku logic. Found an interesting article talking about how to properly fill a puzzle for the solution and how to remove sufficient numbers to guarantee a unique solution. 

Hopefully we'll be able to introduce 4x4, 9x9 and other shapes...
